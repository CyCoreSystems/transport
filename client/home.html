<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Accurate data collection and analysis is necessary for transit agencies to provide good service.  Each different mode of transit presents unique challenges in collecting and collating data.</p>

<h2>Our Solution?</h2>

<p>Our initial goal was to source data from multiple transit modes, clean and translate it into a common format, and make it available to agencies and developers for easy analysis and fast application development.</p>

<h2>More Problems!</h2>

<p>We discovered that there simply is not enough data currently available to make this service functional.  However, the best way to provide improved services without significant infrastructure investment is for agencies and technologists to work together to make data on services and usage openly available, so we elected to continue in order to demonstrate a few potential applications.</p>
