<h1>The Problem</h1>

<p>Accurate data collection and analysis is necessary for transit agencies to provide good service. Each different mode of transit presents unique challenges in collecting and collating data.</p>

<h2>Our Concept</h2>

<p>Our initial goal was to collect data from multiple transit modes, clean and translate it into a common format, and make it available to agencies and developers for easy analysis and rapid application development.</p>

<h2>Pivot!</h2>

<p>While we found a plethora of static data (e.g. routes, schedules, locations) we discovered that the data we needed - usage data - was the exact kind of data that was not available to us. Usage data seems to what agencies want to acquire as well. For example, if we could access the number of total MARTA cards used per day and where each MARTA card was swiped, we could show concentration patterns during busy times, display the busiest stop locations, etc.<br>

However, the best way to provide improved services without significant infrastructure investment is for agencies and technologists to work together to make data on services and usage openly available, so we elected to continue in order to demonstrate a few potential applications.</p>
